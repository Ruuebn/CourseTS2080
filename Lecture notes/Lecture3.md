UML

- General-purpose visual modelling language
- UML is a modelling language, not a description of the development process
- Specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system
- Decisions and understanding about systems must be constructed
- A standard (not really)
- The process of developing a diagram is not standardized
- Not a programming language
- Cater to whomever you're communicating with
    - Investors don't need details of everything
    - However, engineers need it


Benefits of UML

- Quick understanding
- Simplify any system
- Communicate with non-engineers easily


Types of UML diagrams

- Split in two families
    - Structure diagrams
        - Class
        - ...
    - Behavior diagrams
        - Use
        - Activity
        - Sequence
        - ...


Complexity of UML

- UML is a product of a democratic process
- Not clean or coherent
- Overlapping features
- Superfluous features
- Has a general purpose, not narrow like programming languages
- Tension between conceptual modelling and implementation
- Unnecessary to listen to UML absolutists


OO analysis and design

- Identify objects
    - Cyclist
    - Cycle
- Define relationships
    - Cyclist must have a cycle
- Establish interface
- Making design executable
