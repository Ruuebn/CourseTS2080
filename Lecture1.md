- private: only the class has access to data/methods
- protected: the class and subclasses have access to data/methods

security, data hiding, simplicity, aesthetics

## Abstraction

- Prevents code repetition
- Improves flexibility
- Working in large teams

## Inheritance

- Modular codebase
- Code Reusability
- Less development

## Polymorphism

The main concept of Polymorphism is method overriding
One class can have many forms
